## what we learnd || use in js file ?
<hr>


<p> The variable and how to declare it, the functions and objects, and how to print anything on a webpage using JavaScript using the statement: document.write('here we put our text')."
<br>
Switch statement: We can use a switch statement to check different cases and determine which one is true.
<br>
Loops: The for loop and the while loop are two types of loops that can be used in JavaScript.</p>

the constructor:is considered a special function used to create and initialize objects of a specific type. It is used when creating a new instance of the object using the keyword "new". The constructor is defined as a function in the class or the object and usually contains the variables and properties that the object needs.
<br>
The importance of the constructor lies in providing a means to easily and orderly build and initialize objects. The constructor can meet the individual needs of each object by initializing its own variable values. Additionally, functions and methods can be added to the constructor and assigned as shared functions for all created objects.
<br>
By using the constructor, object creation and management can be unified effectively. It can also be used to create multiple copies of the same object easily, facilitating data management and interaction between objects in your program,by using it we reduce the size of our code and the time that we need
to do a specific task (code). 
<br>
In general, the constructor is considered one of the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and contributes to making the code more organized and maintainable.

Is It More Important Than Object Literals ?
<br>
the importance of constructors and object literals depends on the specific requirements and design patterns used in a particular programming scenario. Both concepts have their roles and can be valuable tools in different programming contexts.
